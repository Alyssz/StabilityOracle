# Stability Oracle: A graph transformer framework for identifying stabilizing mutations

## Model Inference
- To generate predictions, use the `scripts/run_stability_oracle.py` cli. Example commands are provided in `scripts/generate_predictions.sh`
- Datasets and predictions are provided in the data directory
- Due to their size, graphs need to be downloaded from Zenodo


## Thermodynamic Permutations
To augment a dataset with thermodynamic permutations, use the `scripts/run_permutation.py` cli. Example commands are provided in `scripts/generate_permutations.sh`

## Figures in Paper
- Code to generate figures in the manuscript is provided in `StabilityOracle/figures`
